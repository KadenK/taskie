### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Component structure will be defined using proper HTML with multiple dynamic components that will be show/hidden through React to create the effect of a dynamic, single-page app
- **CSS** - Stylization will be used for the on-screen organizations of the various components that will adapt to the screen size. It will have a unique theme throughout the application.
- **React** - Conditional rendering of various React-defined components in the style of a single-page dynamic application
- **Service** - A backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - Reading/writing user's task list
    - Accessing public weather API
- **DB/Login** - Store users and their task lists in a database. Authenticate users, save a user's task list if signed in to be accessible anywhere
- **WebSocket** - When a shared list is modified, the modification is broadcasted to all users currently on the shared list
